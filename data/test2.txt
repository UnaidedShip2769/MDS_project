I am trying to understand the difference between insert for multiset and merge, in the context of merging. Insert takes O(logn) for each insert, so O(nlogn) in total; where n is size of smaller container. Whereas merge only needs O(n1+n2). The only reason I can think of for using insert is that it accepts any iterator and the fact that the second complexity has a coefficient of three before it. Is there any other strong reason to favour insert over merge.
